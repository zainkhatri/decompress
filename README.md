/*DecompressingFile is a Java program designed to decompress files encoded using Huffman coding. This utility reads a compressed file and its associated Huffman codes, then reconstructs the original text based on these codes. It's especially useful in scenarios where data compression is critical, such as transmitting data over limited bandwidth connections or storing large amounts of data efficiently.

Features
File Decompression: Capable of decoding files compressed with Huffman coding, restoring them to their original state.
Huffman Code Handling: Reads and interprets Huffman codes stored within the compressed file, ensuring accurate decompression.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for common issues, such as incorrect file paths or unsupported file formats.
