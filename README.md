# DecompressingFile

**DecompressingFile** is a Java-based utility designed to decompress files encoded using **Huffman coding**. This tool reads a compressed file along with its corresponding Huffman codes and reconstructs the original content. The program is particularly useful for scenarios where data compression is important, such as when transmitting data over bandwidth-constrained connections or storing large datasets efficiently.

## Features

- **File Decompression**: The program can decode files compressed with Huffman coding and restore them to their original form.
- **Huffman Code Handling**: Reads and interprets Huffman codes embedded within the compressed file to ensure accurate and efficient decompression.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for common issues like incorrect file paths or unsupported file formats.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The program accepts a compressed file that contains the encoded data and its corresponding Huffman codes.
2. **Decompression Process**: The encoded data is processed by using the provided Huffman codes to reconstruct the original file.
3. **Output**: The original file is restored and saved at the specified output location.

## Installation
